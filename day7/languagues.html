      <div class="col-sm-3"><img src= https://aptonic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/python-logo.png>python: is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.[22][23] The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.</div>

        PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994,[4] the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Development Team.[5] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[4] but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[6</div>

In comparison to older read/write APIs like ISAM or VSAM, SQL offers two main advantages: First, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command, and second, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g.: with or without an index.</div>

The first major program written in C was the Unix operating system, and for many years, C was considered to be inextricably linked with Unix.</div>

        java: Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. </div>
