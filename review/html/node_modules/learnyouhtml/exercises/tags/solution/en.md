# Neat!

Now you know how basic HTML document looks like.

Here we need to tell you more about how you can use tags. Tags are case insensitive, so `<br>`, `<BR>`, `<Br>` and `<bR>` works exactly the same. Anyway, we recommend you to write tags in lower case, which is more readable and generally accepted.

If a tag is written with mistake, then browser will ignore this tag, so it would looks like there is no any tag.

Important, there is a special kind of tag: comment. Like in any markup or programming language, sometimes you need to leave a message in your code, so you write comment. In HTML comments are declared using this:

```html
<!-- this is a single-line comment -->

<!--
  this
  is
  a
  multi-line
  comment
-->
```

Use comments to describe specific places in your code. That might be helpful for other developers, including you, to understand this markup in future.

Okay, let's go back to the `<meta charset="utf-8">`. It doesn't look like a usual tag. What is `charset="utf-8"`? Well, this is an _attribute_ with _value_ and we're going to consider them in following exercise.
