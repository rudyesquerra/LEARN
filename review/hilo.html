          //Javascript Hi/Lo Game
          // Goal
          //
          // Create a function that plays the following game: The computer picks a secret random integer between 1 and 100 (both inclusive), and repeatedly asks the user for guesses.
          // If the user's guess is too high or too low, the computer notifies them of that
          // Otherwise, if the user guesses the secret number correctly, the computer displays a winning message and the game is over.

        var picks; //Define a variable which will be the number that the user picks
        var random = Math.floor(Math.random()*100);//Used Math.floor() to use only integers, and Math.random() to store a random value between 1 and 100 in our random variable.
        var counter = 0; //Define a variable counter that will increase by one each time the user doesn't guess the number
        var name; //Define a variable called name where the user's name will be stored
        function hilo() {
          name = prompt("Tell me your name")//Using prompt, name now has a new value
          do{ //do - while loop initiates
            counter += 1;
            picks = prompt("Pick a number") //User inputs a number and it get stored in our picks variable.
            if(picks === null){
              break
            }
            if(isNaN(picks)){
              alert("Use numbers only")
            }
              if(picks > random){ //Conditional statement where the number picked is compared to random
              alert("The number is too high") // If the guess is too high, user will receive an alert with the message.
            } if (picks < random){
              alert("The number is too low")// If the guess is too low, user will receive an alert with the message.
            } if (counter > 7){
              alert("Too many tries, you loose");
              break
            }
          } while(picks != random)// If the user guesses the number, user will receive an alert with the winning msg.
              if(picks == random){ // Variable comparison, if the pick  equals the guess, then alert "You Won"
              alert("You Won " + name)// Inlude the name variable to show the name
            }
        }
